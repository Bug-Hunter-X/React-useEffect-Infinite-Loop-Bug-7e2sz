This repository demonstrates a common React bug involving the `useEffect` hook.  The `bug.js` file contains code that results in an infinite render loop due to a missing dependency in the `useEffect` hook.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code with the missing dependency added. This example highlights the importance of correctly specifying dependencies in `useEffect` to prevent unexpected behavior.
